Title:
Real-time IoT-based Water Flow Monitoring and Theft Prevention System for Water Supply Networks
An Intelligent Water Management System using IoT and Machine Learning for Efficient Water Distribution

Objectives:
1.Developing an integrated framework for assessing the performance of water supply systems considering multiple parameters such as functionality, operational efficiency, maintenance practices, and
system health.
2.Investigating the impact of emerging technologies such as IoT, AI, and big data analytics on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply systems.
3.Evaluating the effectiveness of different types of water tariffs and pricing strategies in promoting efficient use of water resources and reducing non-revenue water.
4.Developing guidelines and standards for the design, construction, and management of water supply systems that take into account local conditions and contexts.
5. Analyzing the impact of water supply systems on public health and environmental sustainability, and developing frameworks for evaluating their long-term impacts.
6. Create an automated alert system that notifies users of any anomalies or deviations from normal operating conditions.
7. Implement predictive maintenance techniques using machine learning algorithms to prevent equipment failures and reduce downtime.
